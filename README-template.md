## Overview
I really appreciate you taking time to visit this repo. I am aware of the fact that I have not implemented all things properly. I always get stuck into details instead of just
finishing a project. So, I decided to the leave some issues or don't pay much to minor details.
If you find anything wrong or that can be improved, please let me know. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)

Styling and layout of the small component.

### Useful resources
